  <h1>Syed Haider's GitHub Site</h1>
  <p>A well designed software I've have personally used is spotify. This is becuase Spotify is very user friendly and
  intuitive. The software is structured so nicely which allows users to easily explore new music, 
  create playlists, and manage their library. They include search filters for songs which are great for 
  narrowing down songs a user is trying to look for or try to find their prefered music. Features such as "Daily Mixes" 
  is also amazing for trying to find personalized music. Furthermore, spotify's user experience is also great and satisfying because of
  thier smooth transitions and low latency. Moving on, software design is important because it addresses users expierence, performance, and
  versatility. Software design is linked to user experience very heavily because it could make or break user satisfaction and producitvity. 
  For example, if the design is poorly done, the users will struggle navigating and experience frustration which will increase the likelihood of 
  them abandoning the software entirely. Furthermore, software design is important because it allows the software to adapt to an futre changes, 
  considers potential security threats and incorporates measures to protect against vulnerabilities maintainability which means that it will be easier 
  for developers to debug the software if needed.

  <h1>What is happening in the
requirements gathering stage?</h1>
  <p> The requirements gathering stage is a stage that includes gathering developers to define what the software should achieve.
    The stage involves collecting information that the software needs like the users needs, the functionality the software needs,
    or any restraints it might need. There are many ways to go about getting this type of information like conducting interviews, 
    surveys, and workshops which will allow clarification and new insight on the requirements. Well, why is this stage important? 
    This stage is important because  it serves as the foundation for all subsequent phases of development. Having good and well defined 
    requirements is importnt because it gives the developing team a good scope of the goals for the software and this allows for less 
    mistakes or misunderstandings about the software later on. Moreover, having a good and clear requirements improves good communication
    within the developers and without that, the the entire project is at risk of delays, and delivering a product that
    fails to satisfy the users needs.
