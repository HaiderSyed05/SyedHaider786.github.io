  <h1>Syed Haider's GitHub Site</h1>
  <p>A well designed software I've have personally used is spotify. This is becuase Spotify is very user friendly and
  intuitive. The software is structured so nicely which allows users to easily explore new music, 
  create playlists, and manage their library. They include search filters for songs which are great for 
  narrowing down songs a user is trying to look for or try to find their prefered music. Features such as "Daily Mixes" 
  is also amazing for trying to find personalized music. Furthermore, spotify's user experience is also great and satisfying because of
  thier smooth transitions and low latency. Moving on, software design is important because it addresses users expierence, performance, and
  versatility. Software design is linked to user experience very heavily because it could make or break user satisfaction and producitvity. 
  For example, if the design is poorly done, the users will struggle navigating and experience frustration which will increase the likelihood of 
  them abandoning the software entirely. Furthermore, software design is important because it allows the software to adapt to an futre changes, 
  considers potential security threats and incorporates measures to protect against vulnerabilities maintainability which means that it will be easier 
  for developers to debug the software if needed.
