  <h1>Syed Haider's GitHub Site</h1>
  <p>A well designed software I've have personally used is spotify. This is becuase Spotify is very user friendly and
  intuitive. The software is structured so nicely which allows users to easily explore new music, 
  create playlists, and manage their library. They include search filters for songs which are great for 
  narrowing down songs a user is trying to look for or try to find their prefered music. Features such as "Daily Mixes" 
  is also amazing for trying to find personalized music. Furthermore, spotify's user experience is satisfying because of
  thier smooth transitions and low latency.</p>
